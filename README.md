# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide (blueprint) of a website or app’s layout before adding design elements like colors, images, or detailed styling. It focuses on:

Structure – Where elements (buttons, menus, content) are placed.

Functionality – How users navigate and interact with the interface.

User Flow – The path a user takes to complete tasks (e.g., booking a property).

Wireframes are typically low-fidelity (simple, grayscale sketches) or mid-fidelity (more detailed, but still minimal).

Importance of Wireframing in Design
Clarifies Layout Early

Helps teams agree on structure before investing time in high-fidelity designs.

Identifies missing elements (e.g., "Where should the search bar go?").

Saves Time & Money

Fixing layout issues in wireframes is faster than revising polished designs or code.

Focuses on Usability

Ensures intuitive navigation by prioritizing user experience (UX) over visuals.

Improves Stakeholder Communication

Developers, designers, and clients can align on functionality before finalizing the design.

Guides Development

Acts as a reference for frontend developers to build the UI accurately.

Example: Wireframing for an Airbnb Clone
Homepage Wireframe:

Header (logo, search, user menu)

Property cards (image, price, rating)

Filter sidebar (price, location, dates)

Property Details Wireframe:

Image gallery, booking form, host info, reviews section

Tools for Wireframing
Simple/Free: Figma, Balsamiq, Adobe XD (wireframe mode), Pen & Paper

Advanced: Sketch, UXPin

Wireframing is a critical first step in design—it ensures the final product is user-friendly and efficient.

# Types of Wireframes: 
Wireframes can be categorized based on fidelity (level of detail) and purpose. Here are the main types:

1. By Fidelity (Detail Level)
A. Low-Fidelity Wireframes
What: Simple, rough sketches (often hand-drawn or basic digital layouts).

Purpose: Quick brainstorming, early concept validation.

Features:

Black-and-white or grayscale.

Placeholder text (e.g., "Lorem ipsum").

Basic boxes/lines for UI elements.

Tools: Pen & paper, Balsamiq, Figma (low-detail mode).

B. Mid-Fidelity Wireframes
What: More structured digital layouts with clearer spacing and hierarchy.

Purpose: Refining layout and user flow before visual design.

Features:

Simple typography (no real fonts).

Basic buttons/forms (no colors or images).

May include minimal annotations.

Tools: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch.

C. High-Fidelity Wireframes
What: Detailed, pixel-specific designs close to the final product.

Purpose: Finalizing interactions and layout before UI design.

Features:

Real content (no placeholder text).

Accurate spacing, fonts, and grid systems.

May include simple grayscale icons.

Tools: Figma, Sketch, UXPin.
